I've really enjoyed making [wordles](http://www.wordle.net/) recently.  The concept is relatively simple.  Give the wordle application a block of text, a blog post, an article, your novel, whatever, and it will make a beautifully done word cloud of your words, magnified by frequency.  For instance, the wordle below was made of the contents of an earlier blog post.  Click on the image for a better look.

What I found most amazing was the sheer amount of options there are.  After entering your text, you can spend hours adjusting the layout, the font and size of the words, the color scheme, etc.  I could talk about it more, but the real magic is seeing a piece of text that you've written come to life in such a similar, yet distinct medium.  Please, do yourself a favor and spend some time at [www.wordle.net](http://www.wordle.net/).
